# Notice

> Update 2024.5.27

- Since syntax check can be done in a15, we don't require you to implement the two passes `verify-scheme` and `verify-uil`. Feel free to program with them. An implementation that just returns the input as output is accepted.
- We suggest you using `match` macro in your compiler. Please read `docs/Using Match.mhtml` first to get familiar with it.

> Update 2024.6.4
- Before you begin your coding in `a1`, make a new directory named `output` in the project directory. This is used to store the output assembly language and the `.o` file.
- Do not merge all branches in advance!!! Instead, merge the new one after you have completed the previous one. When facing merge-conflict, always choose the incoming changes instead of the former one.
