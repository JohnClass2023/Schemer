# Notice

> Update 2024.5.27

- Since syntax check can be done in a15, we don't require you to implement the two passes `verify-scheme` and `verify-uil`. Feel free to program with them. An implementation with just returning the input as output is accepted.
- We suggest you to use `match` macro in your compiler. Please read `docs/Using Match.mhtml` first to familiar with it.
